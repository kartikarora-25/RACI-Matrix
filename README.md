# RACI-Matrix

This repository contains a **RACI Matrix (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed)** for a hypothetical E-Commerce Website Development project. The matrix is structured to clearly define the roles and responsibilities of different stakeholders involved in the project.

**About the RACI Matrix**
